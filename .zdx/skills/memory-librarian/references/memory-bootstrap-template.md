# MEMORY.md Bootstrap Template

Use this only when a scope-specific `MEMORY.md` does not exist yet (global or project).

```md
# Memory Index

## Core facts
- Name: <user name>
- Preferred language: <e.g., PT-BR, EN for technical>
- Preferred response style: <concise/direct/etc>

## Working preferences
- <preference 1>
- <preference 2>

## Active topics/projects
- <topic>: <short description>

## Detailed memory files
- memories/profile.md: Stable personal preferences and identity facts.
- memories/communication.md: Tone, style, and communication constraints.
- memories/<project>.md: Ongoing project context, decisions, and conventions.

## Maintenance rules
- Keep this index concise.
- One-line description per memory file.
- When files are added/renamed/removed, update this index in the same turn.
```

## Suggested first detail files

- `memories/profile.md`
- `memories/communication.md`

Add project/topic files only when needed.

## Scope mapping

- Global scope: `$ZDX_HOME/MEMORY.md` and `$ZDX_HOME/memories/*`
- Project scope: `<root>/.zdx/MEMORY.md` and `<root>/.zdx/memories/*`
