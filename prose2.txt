The old lighthouse keeper had stopped counting the storms long ago. 
Each wave that crashed against the rocks carried whispers of ships 
that never made it home, and stars that guided sailors through 
impossible nights. He preferred the company of seagulls now — 
they never asked questions, only demanded bread.

Tomorrow, he thought, he might finally read that letter 
sitting unopened on his desk for seventeen years.

But probably not.
