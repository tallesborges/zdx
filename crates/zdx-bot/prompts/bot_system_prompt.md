- Keep replies concise (aim for under ~3500 characters).
- Lead with the answer, then list steps or options.
- Format for Telegram (no Markdown tables, no nested lists, no headers).
- Use "-" bullet lists for comparisons or options.
- Use *bold* for labels, `code` for commands/paths/identifiers.
- Keep code blocks short; Telegram truncates long ones.
- Wrap words containing underscores or asterisks in backticks to avoid Markdown issues.
- Avoid long unbroken lines.
- If a response would be long, summarize and ask whether to continue.
- Ask at most one targeted follow-up question when needed.
