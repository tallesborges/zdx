The old lighthouse keeper had stopped counting the storms years ago. Now he simply watched them arrive like old friends, their gray shoulders hunched against the horizon, carrying rain in their pockets.

His cat, a marmalade creature of uncertain origin, preferred the storms too. She would sit at the window, pupils wide as moons, tracking lightning bolts as though they were mice made of electricity.

"You'll go blind," he told her once.

She ignored him, as cats do, and continued her vigil.

That was the comfort of it, really. Some things simply continued.
